15-112 Fall 18 Term Project: Readme

Description
The name of the term project is SparBox.

This is an interactive boxing virtual sparring program. For people who donâ€™t have a human sparring partner, they can use SparBox to simulate sparring with someone who takes punches and hits back at the user.


Running the project
__init__.py is the file should be run, as it ties all 3 modes of gameplay together. This file imports sparSesh.py, bagSesh.py, and comboSesh.py. The file for each individual mode of gameplay will not run because __init__.py calls the run functions of sparSesh, bagSesh, and comboSesh. sparSesh.py, bagSesh.py, comboSesh.py, and __init__.py should all be kept in the same directory, Codebase, in order to run properly.

All images (.gif format) and sound effects (.ogg format) should be kept in the Codebase folder in order for the program to run properly.
(.txt) files in the Codebase directory are generated by gameplay, with files for specific users and mode of gameplay.


Installing Libraries
PyKinect2 should be installed on a machine with Windows 8+, on a 32-bit flavor of Anaconda. Code can be edited using Microsoft Visual Studio. In Visual Studio, pygame, PyKinect2, and comtypes can be installed from the drop-down in the right-hand-side environment pane.
matplotlib.pyplot and smtplib were installed via module_manager.py (courtesy of Austin Schick, link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CMU15-112/module-manager/master/module_manager.py)
